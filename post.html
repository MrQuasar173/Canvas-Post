    <summary>Image</summary>
    <pre>  &nbsp; One image is when Beau "writes" the following:</pre>
    <pre style="padding: 5px; border: 2px solid blue; text-align: center;" data-darkreader-inline-border-top="" data-darkreader-inline-border-right="" data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom="" data-darkreader-inline-border-left=""><em>"I'm off again: muck, pond, ditch, residue
of any thrillingly dead thing."</em></pre>
    <pre>  &nbsp; This image shows that Beau is just having fun and enjoying anything fun he comes across. 
    This is almost like the dog equivalent of "stopping to smell the flowers" but more accurately 
    "going out to smell the flowers"</pre>

    <summary>Sound</summary>
    <pre>  &nbsp; The quote used for the previous question is a perfect example: the high number of accented 
    syllables/spondees suggest a tone of Beau seeing and being excited by many different things in rapid succession and then 
    moving on to the next. <em><strong>MUCK! POND! DITCH! DEAD THING!</strong></em></pre>
